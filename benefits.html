					  <h2>Stafford and PLUS Loan Repayment Benefits</h2>
					As you are aware, our country  experienced some very rough financial times due to the credit crisis, and unfortunately, we were not spared the effects.  Therefore, it was with great regret that we were forced to modify our borrower benefits for loans that did not enter repayment status by April 1, 2010.  Notification was sent on March 17, 2010 to all NTHEA borrowers who were affected by this change. To view a copy of this letter, <a href="forms/BenefitChange.pdf" title="click here" target="_blank">click here</a>.

Principal reductions are calculated on the total principal amount outstanding after the 12th, 24th and 36th full scheduled qualifying payment is made. The .75% interest rate reduction benefit does not apply during any period of $0 monthly payments under an Income-Based Repayment plan, and any $0 monthly payment under an Income-Based Repayment plan does not count toward the on-time payment benefit requirements. For borrowers with a loan(s) eligible to qualify for the .75% interest rate reduction for auto debit and/or the 1%-2%-3% principal reductions for on-time payments based on origination date or repayment status date, no other auto-debit or on-time payment benefit will be applied to the loan(s). NTHEA reserves the right to change or discontinue the program at any time without notice, but previously qualified loans will not be affected. Other terms and conditions may apply.<br/>
3) The Early Loan Forgiveness (ELF) Program applies to all Federal Family Education Loan Program loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2008, acquired by NTHEA before July 1, 2016, and held by NTHEA at the time of forgiveness. The ELF Program is limited to one benefit per borrower; the borrower must be in repayment to be eligible and must have made at least one full payment on the loan(s); loan(s) paid off by consolidation are not eligible for the ELF benefit. The ELF benefit amount is based on the final balance once the loan(s) is paid down to less than $600. No refunds will be issued if an account is paid in full prior to reaching the “less than $600” threshold. NTHEA reserves the right to discontinue or make changes to the ELF Program at any time without notice, but previously qualified loans will not be affected. Other terms and conditions may apply.<br/>
4) Applies to borrowers who enter repayment after August 1, 1999. The .25% interest rate reduction does not apply during any period of $0 monthly payments under an Income-Based Repayment plan. NTHEA reserves the right to change or discontinue the program at any time without notice, but previously qualified loans will not be affected. Other terms and conditions may apply.<br/>
5) Applies to Stafford loans first disbursed on or after August 1, 1996 through June 30, 2007 and PLUS loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2007. Any $0 monthly payment under an Income-Based Repayment plan does not count toward the on-time payment benefit requirements. NTHEA reserves the right to change or discontinue the program at any time without notice, but previously qualified loans will not be affected. Other terms and conditions may apply.</span>

As you know, due to unforeseen financial circumstances, we have been forced to modify our borrower benefits for loans that did NOT enter repayment status as of April 1, 2010.  These loans will not be eligible to receive either of the following benefit options:
<br/><br/>
               NTHEA’s Rate Reduction Benefits Program*<br/>
                         •  2.5% interest rate reduction after 48 on-time payments
<br/><br/>
               NTHEA’s Borrower Savings Program**<br/>
                         •  1% principal reduction after 12 on-time payments<br/>
                         •  2% principal reduction after 24 on-time payments<br/>
                         •  3% principal reduction after 36 on-time payments
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-size:12px; line-height:11px">* Applied to Stafford loans first disbursed on or after August 1, 1996 through June 30, 2007 and PLUS loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2007.</span><br/>

<br/><br/>
As previously disclosed, NTHEA continues to reserve the right to change or discontinue borrower benefit programs at any time without notice, but previously qualified loans will not be affected. It is with deep regret that we were forced to exercise this option of modifying our benefits.  It is our intention to monitor our future financing costs, and if it should become feasible again, we will consider offering our borrowers additional discounts.

Savings are applied to the principal balance outstanding so that payment amounts will not change, but the repayment period is shortened; however, the option to lower monthly payments is available.</span>
